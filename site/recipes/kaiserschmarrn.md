   <li><span data-base="250" data-unit="ml" data-roundto="25">250ml</span> milk</li>

**Instructions:**
1. Pour milk into a large bowl. Gradually whisk in flour until smooth, making sure the flour doesn't clump.
2. Let rest for at least 30 minutes (2 hours works well too).
3. Preheat pan on high heat with half the butter.
4. Beat the eggs with a fork --- doesn't need to be perfect.
5. Gently fold eggs into the rested batter. Maintain the batter's consistency, less mixing is better than more.
6. Pour batter 2--3cm thick into the buttered pan and throw raisins into the batter with momentum. (Alternatively, raisins can be briefly saut√©ed in butter first.) Cover with lid if possible and bake/fry at medium heat.
7. When edges, bottom and ideally most of the pancake has firmed up, flip over. Cook/fry for similar time on the second side.
8. Finally, increase heat and tear into pieces, melting remaining butter in a gap. Toss/stir pieces to distribute butter. Sprinkle a thin layer of granulated sugar over and distribute well. Caramelize with butter and sugar as desired.
9. Serve in the pan or on plates with applesauce or plum compote.

**Tips:**
- Two wooden spatulas are advantageous
- A too-small lid can be supported with a spatula lying flat across the pan rim
- Let liquid batter run down at the edges before flipping the firm pieces
- Let the pan cool slightly at low heat before continuing to work
