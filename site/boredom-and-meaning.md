When I was in high school, a friend told me I should take more
care to enjoy my time here, as there would not be a more relaxed
period in my life with more free time for me to do what I love.
With some well-meaning contempt, I told him I would be devastated
if I assumed this to be the peak moment of my life.

The below was my last full year of school (the one before leaving exams, they cut the second half of the year short). Beautiful, isn't it?

Now, this is what my last year of school looks like. You can see
I prepared for leaving exams in April, worked on an open-source
project during an internship in the summer, and started studying in
September.

Ever since I started studying, my coding activity has stayed low.

How upsetting! Maybe my friend was right.

Well, no, I'm still convinced I didn't peak in high school. I am
upset though about not getting to program much.

The first semester at ETH was genuinely challenging to me. I
also spent a lot of energy outside of school, developing and
changing as a person, so it's no surprise I had little free
time or energy to spend on programming.

The pressure of the first semester has faded, though, ever since
I passed the first block of exams with reasonable (larger
than ever before) effort and acceptable grades.

Equipped with the knowledge of what is required to pass exams, I
have been drifting through the first month of the new semester.
University is still challenging intellectually, but it's much more
manageable than last year, and it's taking me less time.

But still, I struggled to find the energy to work on my own
projects again (and also eat well, do sports and have a social
life). At the same time, I am bored with doing schoolwork all day,
and I miss the joy and meaning I found in programming.

I started doing OS hacking right after I graduated from high school
last year. I had done a lot of low-level programming before -- some
OS stuff even -- but I hadn't seriously focused on OS programming.

At the time I figured I should learn more about (a) OS development and
systems programming or (b) AI and machine learning. I was already
leaning towards option (a) because I saw a lot of value in better
understanding computer systems, and then someone came along and
offered me to do an internship working on kernel code. I accepted.

In my free time, I began writing an [x86\_64 bootloader](/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html)
and them some more OS primitives. Working on this sporadically
ever since, I now have a lot of the basic x86 stuff working
(interrupts, paging, privileges), enough C primitives to be
somewhat productive, allocators, an in-the-works RAM fs, the
first syscalls, and some tiny drivers.

When I did focus on the project for a few weeks, I made progress
quickly. OS development can be quite challenging, though, and
I got stuck more than once, leading me to quit the project for
a while and come back later.

I plan to work on this for the next few weeks. For accountability
reasons, I want to document some progress here. It's fine if I
decide to quit and do something else later, but I want to make
a consistent effort to see where it leads first.

I will work on this in the mornings as the first thing of the day.
This way I have the energy to do the work. It also makes me more
energetic throughout the day, and I'm in a better mood, because
I already did something fun and challenging.

There are many more projects to work on, but focus is key. From
now on, I will spend a month on this project and only switch to
something else thereafter. It's fine if I do switch, but my OS
project is cool, and I want to give it a fair shot now that I'm
more settled in at university.

Zurich is beautiful, by the way. Have a good day, friend.
