  <a href="/archive.html">Link Archive</a>
</h1>

I maintain an archive of pages that I link to in my posts in the `/archive` and `/public/archive`
directories on this website (see the [page source code](https://github.com/thass0/thass0.github.io/)).
The web changes all the time and there is no way to be sure that content I once linked to will remain
accessible in the future. To protect against this, I download copies of most pages that I link to and
save them in `/archive` (HTML) and `/public/archive` (PDFs, images, etc.). This way, I can be confident
that future readers of my blog will have access to all relevant information. The archive will only
disappear when the rest of my blog does.
