![Picture saying "All content on this blog, unless otherwise noted, is released into the public domain." written in the DOOM font](/static/figures/public-domain.png)

I do not want to participate in the practice of copyright for
work I do not financially depend on. This blog is something I do
for fun, and it should deliver maximal value to others. Making all
content freely and unconditionally usable furthers this purpose.

I took the liberty to adopt the same public domain dedication
notice as [nullprogram.com](https://nullprogram.com/). The text
at the top of this page was generated with the awesome
[Doom text generator](https://c.eev.ee/doom-text-generator/).

All materials in the [archive](/archive.html) are subject to their
original licenses and terms.
